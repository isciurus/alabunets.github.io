I am a researcher, I apply an adversarial mindset to problems in computer science. My current work focuses on adversarial examples and attacks against AI assistants and large language models.
I work with [Earlence Fernandes](https://www.earlence.com/), and I am a part of [Systems and Networking](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/) and [Security and Cryptography](https://cryptosec.ucsd.edu/) groups at UCSD.
Sometimes, I do interdisciplinary research, such as on [national security letters reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02768) and [natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06710).

Previously, I worked as a security engineer at Facebook. Our investigation of the NSO Group exploit against WhatsApp has been featured in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/how-democracies-spy-on-their-citizens).
